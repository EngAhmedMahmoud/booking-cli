## Booking system CLI
In this example we have created a booking system cli using golang which enables users
to book the number of tickets then send them tickets via email.
## Architecture
In this example we are using the flat architecure which all files in the same directory
same package to reduce the complexity of creating and managing the packages
this architecure suits for small scale projects,modules and cli but if we have a large scale project in this case we should use a layered architecure or other types of architecure which suits the large scale projects and helping to maintain the project structure.
## Running
After clone the repo and inside the project directory just run the following command:
```
go run .
```
